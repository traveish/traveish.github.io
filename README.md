# `whois Trave`

__&rarr; Travis Barney__ is a slightly chubby, yet surprisingly average human being who lives in Salt Lake City, Utah.&nbsp; He spends his time developing web applications, presently working for [Vivint Smart Home](http://vivint.com) as a UI Engineer.&nbsp; You will typically find him hunkered down in his home wearing comfy shorts, but sometimes finds himself outdoors in the Cottonwood canyons with his wife, son, and dogs.

## Motivation

I am making an effort to reciprocate the knowledge I've gained over the years from several open-source communities back out into the world.&nbsp; You might recognize that I am just a schmuck who doesn't really have any unique ideas, and thats okay.&nbsp; My hope is mostly to exercise my writing skills and attempt to consolidate my findings into somewhat helpful tidbits.

## Contact

If you feel like teaching me a lesson for being wrong about something, or wanting me to expound on any ideas further please let me know.&nbsp; I can be found through twitter at  [@travenasty](http://twitter.com/travenasty), mostly consuming things like an information vampire.
