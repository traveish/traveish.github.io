This is my first post… don't worry it will be brief.&nbsp; I am taking some inspiration from one of my co-workers [Kyle Redfearn](https://www.kyleredfearn.com/) and taking a stab at blogging, finally.&nbsp;  I have been creating web apps for business for almost 20 years now, and I feel its about time for me to make a real effort at writing and sharing what I've learned to document the strategies and tactics I use today, so that I can make fun of myself later.

I decided to be cheap and take advantage of [GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/), so that it's free and to avoid fidgeting with layers of development tooling configurations.&nbsp; I'm pleased that [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) is baked right into the GitHub Pages experience, and all I've got to do is add markdown files and commit my changes to the repo… and voilà its live.

Anyway, tonight I look forward to eating some delicious food with my wife [Laura](http://twitter.com/ljb801) tonight at [Nuan's Thai Kitchen](http://www.nuansthaikitchen.com/)… so I am gonna duck out a little early from work all sly like, don't tell anyone please. ❤︎
